# CASSPER: A Semantic Segmentation based Particle Picking Algorithm for Single Particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy

This repository contains the following:
## CASSPER Labelling Tool
The Labelling Tool is used to generate segmented labels for fresh training of CASSPER. The tool, sample mrc files and labels are given in the sub folder. All the labels used for the study is also provided. The instructions and Demo video for operating the labelling tool is also given in the subfolder.

## Fresh Training



If prediction without training is to be done, the folder TSaved, containing the saved weights, should be added into the respective protein folder. The saved weights used by CASSPER can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vi4N8RSObD6Oa_pCRcyZ2MS8WzbDT-7b?usp=sharing
